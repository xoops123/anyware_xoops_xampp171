~When there is a conflict (i.e., multiple comments were posted at the same time), the comment is displayed at the top or at the bottom (according to the setting) even if the radio button is checked. This is to prevent the comment from being inserted to a strange place.
~When a comment is posted, the plugin displays the message indicating that the page where the plugin is placed has been updated. However, it is the comment page that has been actually updated.
~Since the page containing #pcomment is not updated, it doesn't show up on the "recent changes" page.
~Avoid using a relative reference (e.g. [ [../] ]) in comments, as it may not be converted as expected. (Keep in mind that the page in which you are writing comment is different from the page that will display it.)
~The logging of the old comments is invoked when the number of comments reached to (PLUGIN_PCOMMENT_AUTO_LOG + PLUGIN_PCOMMENT_NUM_COMMENTS).

~The description method recommended by the one prepared to maintain the previous version and interchangeability is (1) in the description method of (2) among two above-mentioned kinds of descriptions. &br;
Operation general even if it is which description method is the same. However, it is likely not to function normally when the following specification is done so that the image displayed like a so-called banner image may become a link to another page. 
 (1)  [[&ref(hoge/fuga.jpg,nolink,Site name);>URL of target site]]

Because Synopsis of (6) is a description method of (2) in this The purpose is to expect PageName of the following Parameters of attached file name fuga.jpg.
