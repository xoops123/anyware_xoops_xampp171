*Text Formatting Rules [#te82f1fe]

Most text is displayed as it is written.

- HTML tags cannot be used. They are just displayed as texts (e.g., <font color="red">text</font>).
- Place an empty line after each paragraph. Lines without an empty line between them are interpreted and displayed as a single paragraph.

Use the formatting rules below to decorate texts. For the formatting with plugins, only the most commonly used ones are explained here. See [[PukiWiki/1.4/Manual/Plugin]] for the details of the plugin options.

----

The input text of PukiWiki is usually shown in the same way as it was entered. However, you can use the following rules to enhance your texts. The use of HTML tags is forbidden. Instead, special characters can be used to format text. Formatting rules usually apply to a certain part of the text. Such a part of a text is called a text Element. 
**&aname(elements);Elements [#vec0ef3a]
First of all, let's describe the "world" of PukiWiki. PukiWiki treats text as a set of Elements. An empty line indicates the end of an Element. Elements can contain other Elements. Such contained Elements are called "Child Elements". The element which contains "Child Elements" is called a "Parent Element". 

Example:
These two lines:
 ~This is a paragraph. It is the parent element which contains an emphasized text element.  
 ''This is emphasized text, which is the child element of the paragraph element.''
Will be formatted like this:
~This is a paragraph. It is the parent element which contains an emphasized text element. 
''This is emphasized text, which is the child element of the paragraph element.''

There are two kinds of elements in PukiWiki: "Block Elements", and "Inline Elements". 
Block Elements, as the name suggests, consist of a whole block of text. Inline Elements
only consist of a part of a text block. In essence, the difference between Block Elements and Inline Elements is as follows:  
-A Block Element:
--Can contain other Block and Inline Elements.
--Can be the Child Element of another Block Element.
-An Inline Element:
--Is always the Child Element of another Element.
--''Can'' contain other Inline Elements as its Child Elements.
--''Cannot'' contain other Block Elements as its Child Elements.

Next, we'll decribe the two different kinds of elements in detail.

**&aname(block);Block Elements [#d2efdb6c]
-A Block Element can contain other Block Elements and Inline Elements as its Child Elements. However, a Paragraph, a Heading, a Horizontal Line, and a #(Plugin[Block]) cannot contain other Block Elements as their Child Elements.
-As we said before, an empty line after a Block Element closes all the Child Elements and Block Elements above at once.
-Block Elements can be Child Elements of other Block Elements.
--List and Quotation Elements can contain other Block Elements as their Child Elements. Block Elements in Child Elements inherit the indent level of its Parent Element. As always, an empty line ends the Block Element.
--List and Quotation have three levels of depth, which are all independent. So, if you want to contain a List Element in a Quotation Element, or a Quotation Element in a List Element, you don't need to increase the indentation level of the Parent Element.
&br;&br;
But if you want to contain a List Element in another List Element, or Quotation in another Quotation as its Child Elements, you need to increase the indentation level of Parent Element.
&br;&br;
It may seem difficult explained like this, but it's probably more simple than it seems. Please check "Nesting Elements" for concrete examples.
-"<","<<",and "<<<" enable you to close a Quotation in a Child Element without closing the Parent Element it belongs to.
--"<" lets you get out of the Quotation Level1 Element.
--"<<" lets you get out of the Quotation Level2 Element.
--"<<<" lets you get out of the Quotation Level3 Element.
-Empty Line closes not only the Quotation Element but also the Block Element it belongs to.
-# indicates the beginning of Plugin Block. (Plugin has 2 modes:Block and Inline.)

***&aname(paragraph);Paragraph [#g3ebf1a7]
 Inline Elements
PukiWiki assumes that each new Block is the beginning of a new paragraph, unless you instruct it to format the text differently, by using the formatting codes of other Block Elements.  
 ~Inline Elements
A line that starts with "~" indicates the beginning of a new paragraph. "~" also enables you escape the special characters (~, -, +, :, >, |, #, //) that are normally used as "Formatting Characters". Normally, these characters indicate the beginning of another kind of Element. Thus, the only way to put the special characters as a normal text at the beginning of a Paragraph is by putting a "~" in front of them.
-The first line of a Paragraph and a Paragraph in a Definition List are indented. But neiher a List nor a Quotation are indented.
-Each Paragraph continues until the appearance of a new Block Element.
-Paragraphs ''can'' be Child Elements of other Block Elements.
-Paragraphs ''cannot'' contain other Block Elements as its Child Elements.
***&aname(quotation);Quotation [#j2411a69]
 >Inline Element
A ">" character indicates the beginning of Quotation. Quotation has 3 indentation levels, indicated by: ">", ">>", and ">>>".
-A Quotation can contain other Block Elements as its Child Elements.
-As with all Block elements, a Quotation continues until the next empty line.
-A Paragraph in a Quotation continues until the beginning of another Quotation or Block Element.
-Quotations can be Child Elements of Other Block Elements. (Look at Nesting Elements for concrete examples.)
--When Quotation is a Child Element of another Quotation, you need to increase the inentation level by 1.
--When Quotation is a Child Element of List, you don't need to increase the indentation level.
-When Quotation contains List as its Child Element, you don't need to increase the level.
-If you want to close a Quotation in a List, and keep the List Element opened, you have to start a Quotation Element with "<","<<","<<<" instead of ">",">>",">>>".
-"<","<<",and "<<<" enable you to close Quotation in List without closing the List it belongs to.

***&aname(lists);List [#adf32d50]
 -Inline Element
At the beginning of a line,"-" indicates the beginning of an Unordered List. Unordered lists have three levels, namely:"-", "--", and "---".
-Unordered List may be contained by anoother Block Elements.
-Increase the level by one when it is contained by other List. If it is contained by a Quotation, you do not have to increase the indentation level.
-Unordered List may contain a Paragraph by writing "~" right after "-".
-Unordered List may contain another Block Element by writing it in the next line ''as long as the beginning of Child Element is Inline Element or Paragraph''.
 +Inline Element
At the beginning of a line, "+" indicates the beginning of Numbered List. Numbered List has three levels namely:"+", "++", and "+++".
-Numbered List may be contained by another Block Elemnt.
-Increase the level by one when it is contained by other List. If it is contained by a Quotation, you do not have to increase the indentation level.
-Numbered List may contain a Paragraph by writing "~" right after "+".
-Numbered List may contain another Block Element by writing it in the next line ''as long as the beginning of Child Element is Inline Element or Paragraph''.

 :Item|Item's Definition
Definition List is a line starting with ":" and seperated by "|" in the middle. There are three indentation levels for Definition List: ":", "::", and ":::".

You may ommit the Item or the Definition. You may give mutiple definitions to an  item by writing a sequence of Definition List and ommiting the Item after the first one. 
-Definition List must have "|" in the line.
-Item and Item's Definition must be an Inline Element.
-Definition List may be contained by another Block Element.
-Increase the indentation level by one when it is contained by other List. If it is contained by a Quotation, you do not have to increase the indentation level.
-Definition List may contain a Paragaph by writing "~" right after "|".
-Definition List may contain other Block Elements by writing a Block Element in the line right after the Definition List.
***&aname(preformed);Preformatted Texts [#x97a82ed]
"White Space" at the beginning of a line indicates the beginning of Preformatted Text. Line breaks are not automatically inserted in Prefomatted Text.
//#br
-Preformatted Text can be the Child Element of other Block Elements.
-Preformatted Text cannot contain other Block Elements as its Child Element.
-Preformatted Text Elements will never be parsed by PukiWiki. Thus its contents are displayed "as is".
***&aname(table);Table [#we5546ee]
 |Inline Element|Inline Element|
Inline Elements that are separated by "|", will be formatted as a Table. Remember that there needs to be a "|" character as well before the first Element of the table.

**Compare Link Styles [#v3d91c05]
Here is a section to explain the differences between WikiName, BracketName, InterWiki, Link, and Alias.
***WikiName and BracketName [#nce9618f]
As you know by now, all of them are used in Pukiwiki to make a link to a page.
And the difference betweem them is whether or not you can use spaces, multibyte-characters, symbols, and numbers. Thus, a BracketName would be a better choice if you want to avoid the typical WikiName capitalized link style.  Usually, all Capitalized strings will be shown as a link. However, you can disable WikiNames in pukiwiki.ini.php if you think they are annoying. 

***InterWiki, Link, and Alias [#aae92bd2]
These styles are very similar, so they might be confusing. But each of them has it's own purpose. If you understand the differences, they are all very useful.

First let's focus on their grammatical styles.
 [[pukiwiki:Use PukiWiki]]..........[a]
 [[whatever u like:http://pukiwiki.sourceforge.jp/?Use%20PukiWiki]]...[b]
 [[Another Name>Text Formatting Rule]]......[c]

[a] is an InterWiki styled link. And [b] is a Link styled link.
Finaly, both of them will direct us the same page: http://pukiwiki.sourceforge.jp/?Use%20PukiWiki .
This is so, because pukiwi is defined in the InterWikiName as followins:
 [http://pukiwiki.sourceforge.jp/? pukiwiki] utf8
Thus InterWiki combines two pieces of information. The first piece is a URL defined in InterWikiName, and the other is the information provided by the right side attribute.
InterWikiName is a kind of short cut. You can define any URL for an InterWikiName.

For example, when you create an link to external/internal wiki page, it is annoying to have to type the whole URL each time you want to use it. In this case, as an alternative, you can define an InterWikiName.

As you can see, [c] is a Alias styled link. You can use it to display a different link text for a link to a page in PukiWiki.

In conclusion, the most important difference you need to understand is
'' Which side is which?''

|Link Style|Left Side|Right Side|
|InterWiki|InterWikiName(Defined URL)|Additional URL|
|Link|Link text|Real URL|
|Alias|Link text|Real URL(WikiName/BracketName)|
